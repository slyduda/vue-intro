Introduction resources for front-end developers

Hey all! ðŸ‘‹ 

Thanks for joining! My name is Sylvester and I'm putting this small project together to help aspiring developers figure out how to get started. Over the course of my streams I'll be going through the following to help you build a web application from scratch.

## The Basics - 10/15/2020

#### Prerequisites
Visual Studio Code - We will be using VSCode during the course of this series, but feel free to use whatever IDE you are most comfortable with. 

#### Setup
No setup will be necessary on this first session.

#### Agenda
5:00 PM - 5:30 PM PST HTML, CSS, and JS basics
5:30 PM - 6:00 PM PST Vue Essentials
6:00 PM - 6:10 PM PST Break
6:10 PM - 6:45 PM PST Building an app
6:45 PM - 7:00 PM PST Questions and Feedback

#### Business Challenge
Let's pretend that we just launched an application that allows users to share their experiences about the effects of the quarantine. Well for some reason our boss wants us to add a stories feature to the application, so I guess that's where we're at now... We'll explore how to build a web app story feature so that we can overpopulate the market some more with this feature.
